          <p>Dogs on leashes seem to be on every street block in New York City recently. But a closer look at data from the <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp"> Department of Mental Health and Hygiene</a> finds that overall fewer dogs were licensed in 2020 compared to 2019. But areas in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island remain the highest in dog license rates and this could be attributed to factors like more space and higher budget.</p>

          <p>According to <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/services/dog-licenses.page"> NYC.gov</a>, all dogs are required to be licensed in New York City. The license is valid for one year or up to five years and must be attached to the dog’s collar. If the law is violated, dog owners may be fined. A dog license can help owners report to search for a missing dog, let their dog off-leash, support animal shelters, and simplify medical follow-ups like vaccinations.</p>

          <p>Last year, neighborhoods like the Upper West Side, South Slope, and Richmond County saw the highest rates of dog licenses and that remained consistent with the year prior.</p>

<p>Kaylen Green-Arijeloye and her husband Sam are Prospect Park South residents. They own a 4-year-old Longhaired Dachshund named Lucy who was licensed back in 2017. They said that their building is dog-friendly and they’ve noticed the same amount of dogs in their neighborhood from before the pandemic to now. She said that they pay about $90 a month on pet insurance and food and $1,000 annually on Lucy’s emergency fund. On top of that, they factor in $75 every 3 to 4 months for grooming. The costs they say are reasonable to keep Lucy happy and healthy.</p>

<p>Generally speaking between this year and last, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1130651/pet-ownership-by-generation-us/"> millenials</a> like the Arijeloyes are the generation group with the biggest share of pet owners in the U.S.<p>

<p><a href="https://www.rover.com/blog/cost-of-owning-a-dog/"> Rover</a>, an app and website that connects pet parents with sitters and dog walkers, researched the cost of owning a dog in 2020. They conducted a survey which found that 47% of pet parents spent about $3,400 on their dogs annually, far more than the average, from $650 to $2,115. Pet spending was reduced due to the pandemic especially for about <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1270792/covid-19-reduced-pet-spending-by-age-us/"> two-thirds</a> of younger pet owners who are between the ages of 18 and 34.</p>

<p>Despite high costs, the pet industry is booming. In 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/1369/pet-food/#dossierKeyfigures"> the U.S. pet market</a> estimates that pet food and treats followed by vet care and products make up the largest shares. The sales of pet food in the U.S. reached $44.1 billion including $5.35 billion sales of dry dog food and $1.88 billion sales of wet dog food in 2020. Majority of dog owners feed their pets standard dry or wet food but surprisingly almost <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1270804/what-pets-usually-eat-in-the-us/"> one-fifth of owners</a> said that they cooked for their beloved pet this year.</p>

<p> But dogs did help many people relieve stress over the pandemic making their high and vast expenses worth it.</p>

<p> “She totally changed my level of happiness…just kind of having someone other than Sam to play with and do things with and being forced to go outside instead of being glued to my computer working remotely,” said Mrs. Green-Arijeloye.</p>
